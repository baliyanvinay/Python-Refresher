## What is a pattern?
A pattern is the repeated or regular way in which something happens or is done. In computer science, a pattern would be a way of solving a specific problem, it could be from every solution there emerges a pattern which has proven to be effective.

## What is a design pattern?
Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code. <br>
Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:
- <b>Intent</b> of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- <b>Motivation</b> further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- <b>Structure</b> of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- <b>Code</b> example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

## How many of design patterns are there?
There are 23 design patterns which can be classified in three categories: Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns.<br>
- <b>Creational Patterns</b> provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- <b>Structural Patterns</b> explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
- <b>Behavioral Patterns</b> take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Singleton Design Pattern
A Singleton(from a singleton set in maths) design restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. <br>
### Examples
- Government class with just one object for a country
- Database driver class with just one driver required
- Logger class controlling the logging of whole application
